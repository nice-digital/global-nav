Feature: Guidance list
  As a user of NICE org
  I can use the guidance lists

  Background:
    Given I have a screen that is 1366 by 768 pixels

  Scenario Outline: Navigate to each guidance list tab
    Given I open the url "/guidance/<url>"
    Then I expect that the attribute "class" from element "#<id>" is "active listTab"
    Examples:
      | url            | id                  |
      | published      | linkPublished       |
      | inconsultation | linkConsultations   |
      | indevelopment  | linkUpdatedGuidance |
      | proposed       | linkProposed        |
